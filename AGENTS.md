# Agents

This project uses the **Vibe Descent** framework, orchestrated by a single coding agent:

- **Coding Agent:** `Cursor Coding Agent (me)` — the autonomous assistant currently driving the session (whether branded as Cursor, Codex, Claude Code, etc.). I am responsible for planning iterations, proposing changes, applying patches, and logging progress throughout the optimization loop.

The rest of the framework (proposers, evaluators, critics, trust region logic) acts as tooling that the coding agent steers to reach the target “vibe loss.”
